simple strategy : Go to next checkpoint, stop accelerating 4 turn before arriving and start rotating toward the following checkpoint


You have 2 angles:

1) The angle the pod is "pointing":
Final_Angle = Something between Initial_Angle-18 and InitialAngle+18, according to the new point you set.

2) The angle the pod is "going":
You can obtain this angle from vx and vy:
Angle_in_Radian = atan2( vy, vx );

You can calculate v:
v = sqrt ( vx*vx + vy*vy )

You can decompose the v in vx and vy:
vx = v * cos (angle)
vy = v * sin (angle)

The speed is as I explained before: Final_vx = (Initial_vx + Thrust_vx) * 0,85
The same for vy


Where did you got Thrust_vx ?? We only have Thrust , for example Thrust 200 but we don't know how 200 is decomposed for Thrust_X and Thrust_Y
It's decomposed according to the angle of the pod (angle the pod is pointing).

thrust_x = thrust * cos( angle_pod_is_pointing );
thrust_y = thrust * sin ( angle_pod_is_pointing );

So, as explained in the expert rules, you have:

Target: New angle the pod is pointing;
Thrust: vx = vx + thrust_x & vy = vy + thrust_y
Movement: x = x + vx & y = y + vy
Friction: vx = vx * 0.85 & vy = vy * 0.85
Truncate speed (vx, vy) and Round position (x, y)
